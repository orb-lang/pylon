Perl Hammer bindings
====================

To build and run these bindings, you will need to have
ExtUtils::MakeMaker and make installed. On a Debian system, this just
means that you need perl installed. On a lesser Linux distribution,
this may be all you need, but you're on your own. On Windows or
another UNIX, you're *really* on your own (until we get PRs with
better instructions).
