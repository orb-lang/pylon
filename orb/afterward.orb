** br.argparse

This is where we're going to write a proper arg parser for the =br= command
line.

An important assumption I'm making is that =argparse= is non-destructive of
the command line invocating, such that I can pop a module-level invocation
such as =fm= or =orb= and then call the particular argument parser distinct
to that submodule.
